# Add an Icon
In the upper left corner of each window there is an icon. You can modify this icon by calling the function "setIcon" of the JFXStageController class. As parameter, "setIcon", expects the full path of the wanted icon.  

<b>Watch out!</b> - After calling "showScene" on a JFXStageController, this function is no longer available on the same JFXStageController.
