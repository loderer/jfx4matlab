# jfx4matlab
The jfx4matlab-package enables creating a MATLAB-application with a javaFX gui. Therefore it is not necessary to write a single java-class. Additional to the integration of javaFX in MATLAB jfx4matlab allows testing the logic of the gui.

Before you use the package, it is recommended to read the [general information](doc/GeneralInformation/GeneralInformation.md). After that you can continue implementing a first application by following [this tutorial](doc/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.md).

Once you have finished the tutorial you can deal with this further reading.
